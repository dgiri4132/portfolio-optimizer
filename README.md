# Portfolio optimzation project
This project is my first project and it is a python based tool which optimizes your portfolio to maximize returns using three chosen stocks, investment budget and start and end date.

# Contents
- There is the main file 'main.ipynb' : which is a Jupyter notebook with all code and results.
- There is the main file 'main_clean.py' which is a more cleaner and better optimized version of 'main.ipynb'.
- And there is  'requirements.txt': which has all the libraires that I needed to do the project.
-'LICENSE' for open-source use.
